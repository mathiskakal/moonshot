> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unfortunately, running the app will inevitably lead to a fatal error, as I haven't provided a mock database, or actual connection secrets to substitute to the connection with the production database, to which the access is restricted to company members. A full product demonstration will however be performed during presentation. Thank you for your understanding.
